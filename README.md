## New Career Now

This was the final project I did at Ironhack's Web Development Bootcamp. 

The idea was that, even though there are many people wanting to change careers, some might not know what trainings they can take in order to do so, or where to find them - or even if there's a training that would fit their life situation (in terms of time and money, for example). So, it would be helpful if there was a portal where all the schools and organizations that provide these courses could register and publish the details of the couses they offer. Everything would be gathered in one single portal, instead of scattered in the internet.
